# Atlas
Atlas is a feature-rich plugin loader for SCP: Secret Laboratory servers. It loads as a plugin for the Northwood Plugin API itself, but extends it's API heavily.

- As automatic as possible
  - Atlas registers everything it possibly could automatically, but it's method can be changed per-plugin.
- As simple as it gets.
  - There's nothing hard to learn. The API is pretty much self-explanatory - and even if you need help, you have our extensive documentation in the wiki!
- No dependencies needed.
  - Atlas utilizes a custom plugin format, which allows plugin developers to package their plugin into one file, with it's dependencies.
