# Atlas
Atlas is a feature-rich plugin loader for SCP: Secret Laboratory servers. It loads as a plugin for the Northwood Plugin API itself, but extends it's API heavily.
- Custom Commands
  - Atlas features a fully custom command manager, which allows you to mark a method with one attribute that defines it's name, description and type.
  - No need to worry about command arguments, Atlas handles that for you.
- Extensive API
  - You are provided with everything you could possibly need, from components to dummy players.
- Easy Config
  - Plugins can define a config value by marking it with an attribute. And that's it!
